## 2026-10-15: Sanitize every diagnostic representation

In `docker/llm_collector/extension`, a credential-name regex applied to raw JSON
missed names supported by the form/query policy and values that were not strings.
Decoded URL containers, URL-valued headers, debug paths, and restored session
records provided additional ways around otherwise working capture redaction.

Use one sensitive-name classifier after parsing each recognized representation.
Bound structural inspection and decoding, omit uninspectable content, and use
own-property maps for untrusted member names. Treat session restoration as an
admission boundary: sanitize before publishing records and rewrite the safe
representation. Test the complete popup export and console boundary, including
when capture is off, because testing one capture field cannot establish that the
same credential is absent from neighboring diagnostic fields.

Review caught two boundary errors: recognizing one valid Link target does not
validate the remaining header, and reparsing a safe JSON prefix after truncation
loses long prompts. Consume an entire recognized container before publishing
any of it. Preserve live sanitation provenance outside serialized records, so
admission can distinguish a fully inspected prefix from untrusted restored text.
